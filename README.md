Create a React application that allows users to add multiple students' details (e.g., Registration number, name, age, course, and GPA) to a list. The application should enable users to enter each student’s information and add it to an array, which will be displayed on the screen. Use functional components and React hooks (useState) to manage the form and list.

1.Create a form that allows users to input a student’s details.

2.When the user submits the form, the student’s details should be added to an array of students.

3.Clear the form inputs after each submission so the user can add a new student.

4.Validate that both the registration number and name fields are filled before allowing submission.

5.Add validation to prevent duplicate registration numbers.

6.Display the list of students below the form, showing each student’s details.

7.Display a message if no students have been added yet.

8.Highlight the GPA using three colours for First Class, Second Upper, and Second Lower.

9.Add a delete button next to each student to remove them from the list.

10.Displaying a summary of the students, such as the total number of students and potentially the average age and GPA.
